\begin_layout Chapter
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Often an interest in predictions of future values occurs.
 Sometimes these future values are based solely on a single predictor, whether
 that predictor is another variable or simply the lagged variable of interest.
 However, the case is more often a complex interrelationship of multiple
 variables where future values for all variables are of interest.
 Models that adequately describe these complex interrelationships are the
 focus here.
 Specifically Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models are to be considered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Motivations for VAR Models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the existing literature treats VAR models as the sole dominion of
 economic or financial prediction.
 This is certainly not unreasonable considering the seminal paper by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Sims:1980"

\end_inset

.
 There are, of course, some instances in the literature outside of that
 domain, such as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Cres:Ente:1999"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Free:Will:Lin:1989"

\end_inset

.
 While many of the possible applications for VAR models are economic in
 nature, there are certainly abundant non-economic applications.
 To this end, forecasting will be the main focus of this work, with certain
 topics such as cointegration noticeably absent.
 Cointegration, for example, certainly seems justifiable in certain economic
 applications, but is not necessarily as justifiably in other areas of applicati
on, and certainly not desirable if interpretation or explainability of the
 model and parameters is an issue.

\begin_layout Section
VAR Model Specification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the univariate case, a simple autoregressive model of order 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, AR
\begin_inset Formula $(p)$
\end_inset

, can be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}=\gamma d+\sum_{i=1}^{p}\phi_{i}y_{t-i}+\varepsilon_{t},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is a matrix of deterministic terms to represent the intercept, linear trend
 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, quadratic trend 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{2}$
\end_inset

, or other terms such as seasonal dummies.
 
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

The multivariate extension, VAR
\begin_inset Formula $(p)$
\end_inset

, is simply
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{y}_{t}=\Gamma D+\sum_{i=1}^{p}\Phi_{i}\mathbf{y}_{t-i}+\varepsilon_{t}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}_{t}=\left(y_{1t},\ldots,y_{kt}\right)^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(k\times1\right)$
\end_inset

 random vector, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{i}$
\end_inset

 are fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(k\times k\right)$
\end_inset

 coefficient matrices, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{t}=\left(\varepsilon_{1t},\ldots,\varepsilon_{kt}\right)^{\prime}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

is the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(k\times1\right)$
\end_inset

 error vector such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{t}\overset{i.i.d.}{\thicksim}\left(0,\Sigma\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Here no actual distributional assumptions are made, but that will be addressed
 in subsequent chapters.
 Again, as in the univariate case the first term in the model, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma D$
\end_inset

, is any deterministic terms included in the model.
 The addition of the deterministic term is not often seen, but is included
 here for reasons that will become clear in later chapters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main goal of the VAR model is a better understanding of underlying relations
hips.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

Whether this understanding is simply to describe the relationships between
 variables or to predict future outcomes, it is necessary to achieve a model
 that is both parsimonious and has minimum variance.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

It becomes clear that a fully ranked VAR model may not satisfy either condition.

\begin_layout Standard
Consider 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}_{t}$
\end_inset

, a matrix of 
\begin_inset Formula $k=3$
\end_inset

 time series variables that are hypothesized to depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $p=3$
\end_inset

 lags of previous values.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{y}_{t}=\Phi_{1}\mathbf{y}_{t-1}+\Phi_{2}\mathbf{y}_{t-2}+\Phi_{3}\mathbf{y}_{t-3}+\varepsilon_{t}\label{3 var, 3 lag example}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This model despite its seeming simplicity is not simple, and can be seen
 if we expand the notation in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "3 var, 3 lag example"

\end_inset

 to get
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\mathbf{y}_{1,t}\\
\mathbf{y}_{2,t}\\
\mathbf{y}_{3,t}
\end{array}\right] & = & \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\phi_{1,1,1} & \phi_{1,2,1} & \phi_{1,3,1}\\
\phi_{2,1,1} & \phi_{2,2,1} & \phi_{2,3,1}\\
\phi_{3,1,1} & \phi_{3,2,1} & \phi_{3,3,1}
\end{array}\right]\mathbf{y}_{t-1}+\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\phi_{1,1,2} & \phi_{1,2,2} & \phi_{1,3,2}\\
\phi_{2,1,2} & \phi_{2,2,2} & \phi_{2,3,2}\\
\phi_{3,1,2} & \phi_{3,2,2} & \phi_{3,3,2}
\end{array}\right]\mathbf{y}_{t-2}\nonumber \\
 &  & +\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\phi_{1,1,3} & \phi_{1,2,3} & \phi_{1,3,3}\\
\phi_{2,1,3} & \phi_{2,2,3} & \phi_{2,3,3}\\
\phi_{3,1,3} & \phi_{3,2,3} & \phi_{3,3,3}
\end{array}\right]\mathbf{y}_{t-3}+\varepsilon_{t}.\label{3 var, 3 lag expanded}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 has quite a few parameters to be estimated.
 Specifically it has 
\begin_inset Formula $k^{2}\times p=3^{2}\times3=27$
\end_inset

 plus the variance leading to 
\begin_inset Formula $28$
\end_inset

 parameters to estimate.
 Also this does not even include deterministic terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Motivations for Information Criteria
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To achieve a more parsimonious model and also a lower variance competing
 models must be compared.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

This can be done through a variety of methods, but here the focus is the
 use of information criteria.
 An information criteria allows for the comparison of not only different
 lag lengths, but also subset models of reduced rank.
 This is highly advantageous since it allows for a model with a great deal
 of flexibility.
 The problem now becomes which criteria to use.
 There are many options to solve this problem, such as Akaike's Information
 Criterion (AIC), Schwarz Bayesian Criterion (SBC), Rissanen's Minimum Descripti
on Length (MDL), and Bozdogan's Information Complexity (ICOMP) for some
 examples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Motivations for GA
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the previous section, the example of a seemingly simple VAR
\begin_inset Formula $(3)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=3$
\end_inset

 variables was introduced.
 In light of parsimony and minimal variance, various competing models could
 be compared using some form of information criteria.
 However, like the previous example, this is not as easy as on might initially
 consider.
 To look at all possible subsets for the example would require looking at
 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{k^{2}p}-1=2^{27}-1=$
\end_inset

 over 
\begin_inset Formula $134$
\end_inset

 million models.
 If it took 
\begin_inset Formula $.5$
\end_inset

 seconds to test each model, this 
\begin_inset Quotes grd
\end_inset

simple‚Äù
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

task would take over 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 years to complete.
 All possible subsets is the only way to guarantee the best model among
 competing models, but there are other possibilities for subsetting.
 Unfortunately, traditional procedures such as stepwise selection do not
 tend to perform well.
 This leads to the motivation for the use of an improved search algorithm
 which comes in the form of the genetic algorithm (GA).
 The GA provides a means to search the possible subsets and obtain a new
 optimal model in terms of the information criteria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the remainder of this work is to offer valid alternatives to
 the basic VAR model to deal with the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes grd
\end_inset

real world‚Äù
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

data that often invalidates many of the normal modeling assumptions.
 The hope is to complete that goal while incorporating the novel combination
 of model selection and the genetic algorithm to lead to appropriate models
 that achieve parsimony and minimal variance.
