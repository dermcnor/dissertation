\chapter*{Abstract}\label{ch:abstract}

Often an interest in predictions of future values occurs. Sometimes these
future values are based solely on a single predictor, whether that predictor
is another variable or simply the lagged variable of interest. However, the
case is more often a complex interrelationship of multiple variables where
future values for all variables are of interest. Models that adequately
describe these complex interrelationships are the focus here. Specifically
Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models are to be considered.

There are many potential pitfalls associated with VAR modeling, from
subsetting, to non-normality, to misspecification This work aims to provide
a unified method to model multiple time series. This begins with extensions
to deal with non-normality such as the Power Exponential VAR or Kernel VAR,
continues on with how to model under misspecification, and then how to
properly subset the saturated model. It is concluded with diagnostics of and
prediction with these models. All of these tasks are completed using
Information Criteria and modern selection algorithms such as the Genetic
Algorithm.
